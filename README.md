A revision of TILT, which was solely a Java applet, by splitting it into 
two halves. The first half handles all image-processing on the server 
using Java, and the second half handles the GUI using Javascript and 
HTML5 (and a canvas).

REQUIREMENTS

TILT requires installation of aspell and libaspell-dev on Ubuntu, or their
equivalents on other platforms.

You must also install AeseSpeller from 
https://github.com/schmidda/AeseSpeller.
